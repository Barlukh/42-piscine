## About
This is a collection of all succesfully completed exercises during my February 2025 Piscine at Hive Helsinki (42-school). Only the exercises that passed the Moulinette were uploaded to this repository.
Most of the tasks are just that, tasks that needed to be returned. Main functions are missing and need to be written by the user in order to test the code. Many exercises could be improved and the syntax cleaned.
This repository is mostly just an archive of my studies, and can serve as a reference for future students in a time of need. However, I strongly encourage students to avoid just copy-pasting.
